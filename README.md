This is just a little mod I'm working on for Minecraft 1.7.10, primarily for a friend's server. It adds several creatures.

Anuranths (Ranapithecus Erectus)
  Mutant hybrid frogmen bipeds. Deadly swamp dwellers with predatory instincts.
  
Wood Gnomes (Gnomo vulgaris)
  Short little jerks. Build dirt hovels out in the woods and steal unguarded chests.
